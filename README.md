# Instructions

Modify the `Ghost` class to create a spooky ghost. The constructor should createt
all of the necessary shapes for the `Ghost`, saving references to them in private
member variables.

When you run your project, it will create a picture of a ghost in the file
`ghost.png`. There should be a large Ghost centered in the pic. Once that works,
modify the `main` method in `GhostTest.java` to also call `bigTest()` and run
the program again. Now you should see a whole bunch of ghosts nicely arrangedin the picture `ghosts.png`.
